# Coffee

Open idex.html. Refresh page if it is needed.

I used random latitude and longitude because near my location there is no coffe shop. It will work if there is coffe shops near user location. 
Second part of test isn't finished, I had some problems with link to get json for photos, and I couldn't solve it. I have spent too much time to solve that problem and because of that details page is bad. There is no picture slideshow.
Sorry about that.
