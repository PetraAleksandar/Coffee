# Coffee

Open idex.html.

I used random latitude and longitude because near my location there is no coffe shop. It will work if there is coffe shops near user location. 
Second part of test isn't finished, I had some problems with link for photos json, and I couldn't solve it. And details page is bad. I have spent too much time to solve that problem.
Sorry about that.
